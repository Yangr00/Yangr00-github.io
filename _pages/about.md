I am a Wojcicki-Troper Data Science Fellow at the [Harvard Data Science Initiative](https://datascience.harvard.edu/) in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in the [Division of Biostatistics at UC Berkeley](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/biostatistics), advised by Professor Mark van der Laan. Before UC Berkeley, I studied mathematics and worked as a fellow at the Translational Genomics Research Institute.

During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to serve as both a [BIDS Fellow](https://bids.berkeley.edu/about) and a [Biomedical Big Data Fellow](https://ctml.berkeley.edu/biomedical-big-data-training-program-uc-berkeley). I am also a founding core developer of the [tlverse](https://tlverse.org/) project, a software ecosystem dedicated to targeted learning.

I will be joining the [Department of Biostatistics at UNC](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) as an Assistant Professor in the Spring of 2025.

  My research interests combine causal inference, machine learning and non/semiparametric inference. I am particularly interested in problems arising in adaptive sequential experiments, reinforcement learning and personalized health in general.
